# STATUS: Not Completed
    ## Fix
    Displaying the category names.
        I perceived them as the last valuable element, leaving it for last.
    Learn how to add scroll bars.
        Couldn't learn to draw through Tkinter, a new challenge for next time!
    Delete button.

# Issues:
    It always appeared that I would get the wrong averages.
        However, not using the examples and instead my own answers gave the correct ones.
    Renaming the classroom creates a new file.
        Since there is currently no delete button, new files that are created do not delete their old variants.

# Files:
    I left an example file called: "Classroom.txt". It's essentially a copy of the examples
    given, so any other example could be used.
